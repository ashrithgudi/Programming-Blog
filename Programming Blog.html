        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>The backbone of any website development process, web pages can not exist without
            Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). Hypertext means that the text has links, called
            hyperlinks, embedded in it.</p>
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the
            presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. So it deals with the
            presentation aspect of the site and gives your site its own unique look.</p>
        <h2>Java Script</h2>
        <p>A multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative
            programming styles. It is used to transform a static HTML page into a dynamic interface.</p>
        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language.
            Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
            Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.
            It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural),
            object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included"
            language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
